    <blockquote cite="https://rb.gy/lgliou">
        In life, the part to success
        is often winding and steep, filled
        with obstacles and challenges. However,
        it's the courage to continue that counts.
        After all, success is not just about achieving
        goals but also about the journey and the learnings
        along the way. It's about the resilience to bounce back
        from failures and the determination to keep going despite the odds.
